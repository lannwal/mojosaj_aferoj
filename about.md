# About the Author

Hello there! It's me, a person you never met and have a rather small chance of meeting in your lifetime - unfortunately - since i would love to talk to you.
There is however an interesting property of (real world) social networks that guarantees that we are maximally 6 hops away from each other.
So while we may never meet, there is a staggering chance that i know someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows you.
you could also write me an email and short circuit this.
